# Bit by Bit Demo Sites 

These are some demonstration websites meant to introduce certain HTML and CSS concepts. Many of them may be intentionally flawed or broken to demonstrate a point.


## Organization

Any standalone websites that dont require external files (such as JS or CSS) live in the main repository folder. Anything that needs multiple files gets its own folder.
